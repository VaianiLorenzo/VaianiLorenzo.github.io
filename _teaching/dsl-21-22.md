The course, compulsory for the Master degree in Data science and Engineering, is offered on the 1st semester of the 1st year. The course is focused on the design and implementation of data-driven processes, which are commonly exploited today to extract knowledge from data and support decision-making. Specifically, the course initially introduces the data science process, focusing on all its main phases, and then provides the theoretical and practical knowledge about the data mining and basic machine learning algorithms that are commonly used for analyzing large and heterogeneous data. The course introduces also the Python language and the state of the art data mining and machine learning libraries. Many laboratory sessions, based on a learning-by-doing approach, allow experimental activities on all the phases of a standard data science process (e.g., data preparation and cleaning, data exploration and characterization, data mining algorithm selection and tuning, result evaluation) on the most widespread commercial and open-source products.
